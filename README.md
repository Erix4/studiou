# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a pretty standard React website. It also uses the modules react-router-dom, react-spring, and react-custom-scrollbar.

## Editing

Most of the work goes on in the pages subfolder.
Each page has a file, as well as the Layout file for the header and contact info, and NoPage for 404 errors.
There is also App.css, which has all the css ever.

## Building

Open a terminal in the top level of the repo and run `npm run start`.
This should open the site locally in `localhost:3000`.
